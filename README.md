# Algorithm Distillation
A minimalist from-scratch replication of the AD algorithm ([Laskin et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14215)) in the Dark-Key-To-Door environment, with extra experiments to investigate the way that AD's N independent RL agent dataset format creates a meta-learner out of a training loop that would otherwise be doing regular behavior cloning.
